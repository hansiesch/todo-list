# Todo List App - No dependencies

I built this Todo List application as an excercise to see how difficult it would be to build a simple SPA application without any external dependencies.

**Note:** Most functionality is done in `./src/TodoListItem.js`.

## Run The Application

To run this application you will to install [`live-server`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/live-server) and run as follows:

```shell
npm i -g live-server

# From the root of the project
live-server .
```
